  abstract={This paper studies the optimal and fair service allocation for a variety of mobile applications (single or group and collaborative mobile applications) in mobile cloud computing. We exploit the observation that using tiered clouds, i.e., clouds at multiple levels (local and public) can increase the performance and scalability of mobile applications. We proposed a novel framework to model mobile applications as a location-time workflows (LTW) of tasks; here users mobility patterns are translated to mobile service usage patterns. We show that an optimal mapping of LTWs to tiered cloud resources considering multiple QoS goals such application delay, device power consumption and user cost/price is an NP-hard problem for both single and group-based applications. We propose an efficient heuristic algorithm called MuSIC that is able to perform well (73 percent of optimal, 30 percent better than simple strategies), and scale well to a large number of users while ensuring high mobile application QoS. We evaluate MuSIC and the 2-tier mobile cloud approach via implementation (on real world clouds) and extensive simulations using rich mobile applications like intensive signal processing, video streaming and multimedia file sharing applications. We observe about 25 percent lower delays and power (under fixed price constraints) and about 35 percent decrease in price (considering fixed delay) in comparison to only using the public cloud. Our studies also show that MuSIC performs quite well under different mobility patterns, e.g., random waypoint and Manhattan models.},

  abstract={We propose the Safe Community Awareness and Alerting Network (SCALE), a cyber-physical system (CPS) leveraging the pervasive Internet of Things (IoT) to extend a smarter, safer home to all residents at a low incremental cost. SCALE uses novel networking technologies, commodity sensor devices, cloud services, and middleware abstractions to sense, analyze, and act on sensed events in a distributed manner. It monitors environmental factors (i.e. smoke, explosive gas) and automatically alerts residents via phone upon discovery of a possible emergency, enabling them to confirm the event and contact emergency dispatchers with minimal effort. This article describes the inception, design, development, and deployment of a prototype system to achieve these goals. We discuss lessons learned and future directions for general CPS/IoT platforms.},

  year={2015},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={To investigate reported emergency incidents and provide better situational awareness during an emergency response effort in a shanty town, we envision the use of volunteers with networked sensing devices employed as Mobile Data Collectors (MDCs). These MDCs are heterogeneous depending upon the type of roads they can access. They gather information about events reported dynamically at random and relay it to central command center. We consider the problem of minimizing the Travel Time of such heterogeneous volunteer MDCs and maximizing the gathering of event data before its expiry time. We model this problem as a Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (DVRPTW), which reduces to a Combinatorial Optimization Problem and is NP-Hard to solve. In this paper, we developed two algorithms, Minimum Deviated Walk and Ortho Walk, to dynamically route or reroute the path of these MDCs to capture the data efficiently. We tested the effectiveness of these algorithms with three different classes of MDCs on simulated non- deterministic random sets of events applied to a real road map of Dharavi, a shanty town in Mumbai, India. We show that both these algorithms are capable of capturing 20% more data than a naive algorithm as well as more than 90% of the events generated within a specified time.},

  year={2015},
  volume={1},
  number={},
  pages={145-156},
  abstract={In this paper, we introduce Smart Source, a crowd sourcing based mobile Question & Answer (Q&A) system that aims to provide mobile information seekers with timely, trustworthy and accurate answers while ensuring that information providers are not inappropriately burdened. We tackle this challenge by taking advantage of both static and dynamic context and semantics from mobile users (e.g., Geolocation, social network, expertise/interest, device sensor profiles, battery level) to identify sources of information (i.e., Workers) that are trusted by the user and accurate enough for the questions at hand. Given a question, the Smart Source broker middleware executes a scalable and efficient worker selection algorithm that uses a Lyapunov optimization framework to maximize the utility of worker selection while guaranteeing the stability of the overall system. An associated assignor selection is used to scale the selection process to a large number of users. We implement the Smart Source prototype system on an Android test bed and thoroughly evaluate the system using real world applications and data, in particular those that involve geospatial questions and answers. Evaluation results indicate that Smart Source is efficient and provides superior worker selection compared to baseline approaches. Smart Source is also highly customizable: it employs a general utility function and provides a control knob to tradeoff the optimality and responding time. We believe that Smart Source will pave a way for new mechanisms of interaction among mobile users.},

  abstract={Energy harvesting from environments such as solar energy are promising solutions to tackle energy sustainability in embedded systems. However, uncertainties in energy availability, non-ideal characteristics of harvesting circuits, energy storage (battery or supercapacitor), and application demand dynamics add more complexity in the system. We present a unified model based on discrete-time Finite State Markov Chain to capture the dynamicity and variations in both the energy supply from solar irradiance and the energy demand from the application. In this paper, we exploit the temporal and spatial characteristics of solar energy and propose a deterministic profile with stochastic process to reflect the fluctuation due to unexpected weather condition. Optimal policy to maximize expected total QoS is derived from the presented model using a probabilistic dynamic programming approach. Compared to a state-of-the-art deterministic energy management framework, our proposed approach outperforms in term of QoS and energy sustainability (with less shutdown time) of the system.},

  abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are physical and engineered systems whose operations are monitored, coordinated, controlled, and integrated by a computing, control, and communication core. We propose Cyberphysical-System-on-Chip (CPSoC), a new class of sensor and actuator-rich multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs), that augment MPSoCs with additional on-chip and cross-layer sensing and actuation capabilities to enable self-awareness within the observe-decide-act (ODA) paradigm. Unlike traditional MPSoC designs, CPSoC differs primarily on the co-design of computing-communication-control (C3) systems that interacts with the physical environment in real-time in order to adapt system behavior so as to dynamically react to environmental changes while achieving overall design goals. We illustrate CPSoC's potential through a virtual sensor network that accurately estimates run-time power for variability affected subsystems using noisy thermal sensors in improving system goals and Quality-of-Service (QoS).},

  abstract={While energy harvesting technology is a promising solution toward achieving self-sustainable low power systems, the efficient energy storage for these energy harvesting systems is still a challenge because of high self-leakage (e.g., supercapacitors) and limited life cycles (e.g., batteries). In this work, we propose an adaptive quality-aware energy management middleware framework for energy harvesting embedded systems. Our hybrid energy storage model takes into consideration the battery life cycle, supercapacitor self-leakage, and power loss in the harvesting circuit. The framework has an offline planning phase and a runtime adaptation phase. By incorporating abstract models for battery state of health (SoH) and supercapacitor self-leakage, the offline stage determines the budget for charging and discharging distribution of each storage component and accordingly adapts the application quality of service (QoS). The runtime adaptation phase dynamically adjusts the charging and discharging distribution to the dynamic changes in energy harvesting profile. In comparison with related work, our proposed framework is able to capture the lifetime and characteristics of the energy storage components more accurately during adaptation and hence, resulting in a more sustainable system with realistic QoS.},
