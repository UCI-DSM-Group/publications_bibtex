               challenges of privacy that arise in IoT in the context of smart
               homes. Specifically, the paper focuses on preventing the user's
               privacy via inferences through channel and in-home device
               activities. We propose a method for securely scheduling the
               devices while decoupling the device and channels activities. The
               proposed solution avoids any attacks that may reveal the
               coordinated schedule of the devices, and hence, also, assures
               that inferences that may compromise individual's privacy are not
               leaked due to device and channel level activities. Our
               experiments also validate the proposed approach, and
               consequently, an adversary cannot infer device and channel
               activities by just observing the network traffic.",

               quality and quantity. Existing efforts to detect and localize
               adverse events in the network have explored either installing
               in-situ sensors on junctions or deploying a number of mobile
               sensors through pipes. These approaches have high costs, low
               sensing accuracy, lack sufficient coverage or provide
               intermittent monitoring. In this paper, we combine the benefits
               of in-situ and mobile sensing with various geosocial factors to
               develop a cost-effective hybrid monitoring architecture that
               minimizes the impact of adverse water events on the community.
               The architecture can adaptively adjust sensing resolutions
               on-demand within the network, determine required sensing
               capabilities based on the event, and respond to varying event
               severities. We propose a two-phase planning and deployment
               approach that first integrates network structure, event, and
               community information with simulation based analytics to
               determine locations to install in-situ sensors and mobile sensor

              access is not available in most developing cities, IoT
              deployments must leverage 3G cellular connections that are
              metered and expensive. In order to best utilize the limited 3G
              data plan, we propose two adaptation strategies to drive sensing
              and data collection. The first technique is an
              infrastructure-level adaptation approach where we adjust sensing
              intervals of periodic sensors so that the data volume remains
              bounded within the allocated data budget. The second approach is
              at the information-level where application-specific analytics are
              deployed on-board devices. This use case focuses on multimedia
              sensors that process captured raw media data to lower volume

               can enhance citizens' quality of life and public safety.
               However, budget constraints often lead to limited
               instrumentation and/or the use of low-cost sensors that are
               subject to drift and bias. This raises concerns of robustness
               and accuracy of the decisions made on uncertain data. To enable
               effective decision-making while fully exploiting the potential
               of low-cost sensors, we propose to send mobile units (e.g.,
               trained personnel) equipped with high-quality (more expensive)
               and freshly-calibrated reference sensors so as to carry out
               calibration in the field. We design and implement an efficient
               cooperative approach to solve the calibration planning problem,
               which aims at minimizing the cost of the recurring calibration
               of multiple sensor types in the long-term operation. We propose
               a two-phase solution that consists of a sensor selection phase
               that minimizes the average cost of recurring calibration, and a
               path planning phase that minimizes the travel cost of multiple
               calibrators which have load constraints. We provide fast and
               effective heuristics for both phases. We further build a
               prototype that facilitates the mapping of the deployment field
               and provides navigation guidance to mobile calibrators.
               Extensive use-case-driven simulations show our proposed approach
               significantly reduces the average cost compared to naive
               approaches: up to 30\% in a moderate-sized indoor case, and

               notifications to end users (subscribers) that express interests
               in these data items via parameterized channels. To support
               scalability, we employ a hierarchical architecture that combines
               a back-end big data cluster (to receive publications and data
               feeds, store data and process subscriptions) with a
               client-facing distributed broker network that manages user
               subscriptions and scales the delivery process. A key aspect of
               our broker capacity is its ability to aggregate subscriptions
               from end users to immensely reduce the end to end overheads and
               loads. The skewed distribution of subscribers, their interests
               and the dynamic nature of societal scale publications, create
               load imbalance in the distributed broker network. We

               initial placement of brokers to subscribers, dynamic subscriber
               migration during operation to handle transient and instantaneous

               leverages two architectures: a server-based centralized
               architecture and an edge-based architecture to address the
               problem of scalability of context collection and evaluation.
               SCARF collects the context data efficiently from resource
               constrained mobile/edge and multiple in-situ sensors (not
               resource constrained) deployed in smart environments. In
               particular, SCARF takes a set of contextual queries from
               applications and optimizes the rate at which the context data
               needs to be collected and/or transmitted from the sensor to the
               server. Furthermore, SCARF decides whether the code for
               evaluating context should be executed on the server or on the
               edge. Execution on the edge will result in reduced communication
               between the server and the edge but can result in low
               performance due to resource constraints of the edge. On the
               other hand, evaluation of context on the server, will require
               SCARF to transmit sensor data from the sensor to the server but
               can result in high performance due to high resource availability
               of the server. SCARF is an adaptive framework which generates an

Today, detection of anomalous events (e.g., pipe breaks/leaks, contamination) in such complex distributed settings is time consuming and often takes hours or days. AquaSCALE integrates a multiplicity of data sources and technologies to enable quick and accurate identification of failures under the environment with growing complexity and uncertainties. We highlight essential research challenges in building such a sensor-simulation-data integration platform and illustrate the value of AquaSCALE using community water infrastructures as a driving use case.},

               distributed infrastructures, e.g., water systems, where failures
               are difficult to isolate. We present AquaEIS, an event-based
               middleware tailored to the problem of locating sources of
               failure (e.g., contamination) in community water
               infrastructures. The inherent complexity of underground
               hydraulic systems combined with aging infrastructure presents
               unique challenges. AquaEIS combines online learning techniques,
               model-driven simulators and data from limited sensing networks
               to intelligently guide human participants (e.g., staff) in
               identifying contaminant sources. The framework integrates the
               necessary abstractions with event processing methods into a
               workflow that iteratively selects and refines the set of
               potential failure points for human-driven grab sampling. The
               integrated platform utilizes Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based
               representations along with field reports for event inference;
               reinforcement learning (RL) methods have also shown promise for
               further refining event locations and reducing the cost of human
               engagement. Our approach is evaluated in real-world water
               systems under a range of distinct events. The results show that
               AquaEIS can significantly reduce the number of sampling cycles,
               while ensuring localization accuracy (detected 100\% of the
               failure events as compared to a baseline that can only identify
               38\% of the events).",
