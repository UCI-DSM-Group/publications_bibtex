abstract = {In this article, we design a crowdsourcing system, CrowdMAC, where mobile devices form a local community or marketplace to share network access and transfer data for each other. CrowdMAC enables (i) mobile clients to select and exploit multiple mobile hotspots in its vicinity for data transfer and (ii) mobile hotspots to open their cellular connectivity to admit/serve delay-bounded requests from mobile users for a fee. The evaluations of CrowdMAC indicate that (i) mobile clients can tune preferred trade-offs between cost and delay through a control knob, (ii) mobile hotspots comply with all delay bounds, and (iii) the system ensures stable and efficient transfer.},

  volume={24},

  pages={3634-3647},
  abstract={Open WiFi access points (APs) are demonstrating that they can provide opportunistic data services to moving vehicles. We present CrowdWiFi, a novel system to look up roadside WiFi APs located outdoors or inside buildings. CrowdWiFi consists of two components: online compressive sensing (CS) and offline crowdsourcing. Online CS presents an efficient framework for the coarse-grained estimation of nearby APs along the driving route, where received signal strength (RSS) values are recorded at runtime, and the number and location of the APs are recovered immediately based on limited RSS readings and adaptive CS operations. Offline crowdsourcing assigns the online CS tasks to crowd-vehicles and aggregates answers on a bipartite graphical model. Crowd-server also iteratively infers the reliability of each crowd-vehicle from the aggregated sensing results, and then refines the estimation of the APs using weighted centroid processing. Extensive simulation results and real testbed experiments confirm that CrowdWiFi can successfully reduce the computation cost and energy consumption of roadside WiFi lookup, while maintaining satisfactory localization accuracy.},

  pages={183-198},
  abstract={We present ADDSEN middleware as a holistic solution for Adaptive Data processing and dissemination for Drone swarms in urban SENsing. To efficiently process sensed data in the middleware, we have proposed a cyber-physical sensing framework using partially ordered knowledge sharing for distributed knowledge management in drone swarms. A reinforcement learning dissemination strategy is implemented in the framework. ADDSEN uses online learning techniques to adaptively balance the broadcast rate and knowledge loss rate periodically. The learned broadcast rate is adapted by executing state transitions during the process of online learning. A strategy function guides state transitions, incorporating a set of variables to reflect changes in link status. In addition, we design a cooperative dissemination method for the task of balancing storage and energy allocation in drone swarms. We implemented ADDSEN in our cyber-physical sensing framework, and evaluation results show that it can achieve both maximal adaptive data processing and dissemination performance, presenting better results than other commonly used dissemination protocols such as periodic, uniform and neighbor protocols in both single-swarm and multi-swarm cases.},

  abstract={IoT environments are important and challenging application domains for privacy studies, for two reasons: data collection about people is nearly invisible, and IoT environments typically do not support interfaces that allow users to specify their privacy preferences or to control the personal data collection practices of the environment. It is also well known that IoT environments present rich challenges in managing privacy choices. We present two systems that will support powerful mechanisms to embed and test a diverse set of privacy technologies in an IoT environment in a large School building.},

  abstract={Safe Community Awareness and Alerting Network (SCALE) is a community government/academic/industry partnership effort that aims to deploy, actuate and evaluate techniques to support multiple heterogeneous IoT technologies in real world communities. SCALE2, an extension of SCALE, engages a multi-tier and multi-network approach to drive data flow from IoT devices to the cloud platforms. While devices are used to gather data, most of the analytics are executed in the cloud. Managing and utilizing these multiple networks, devices and technologies is a big challenge that calls for an integrated management. In this context, we propose to leverage a related effort, MINA (Multi-network INformation Architecture), that aims at integrating operations of multi-networks IoT deployments in a hierarchical manner. This paper discusses the mapping of the SCALE2 heterogeneous platforms in the MINA environment and argues for a hierarchical approach to extending and managing community IoT multi-networks. We discuss resilience methods that can be employed at different tiers in the hierarchical architecture. We illustrate examples of how multiple applications can be supported in this heterogeneous setting; example applications include cooperative seismic event detection, mobile data collections for air quality information and assisted living for elders. Finally, we discuss novel research challenges associated with managing multi-network IoT architecture.},

  year={2016},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In this paper, we develop effective solutions for enabling mobile sensing/data collection in community IoT deployments where sensing/communication coverage is intermittent and varying. Specifically, we address the optimized upload planning problem, i.e. determine optimal schedules for upload of gathered information to enable timely data collection in dynamic settings. We develop a two-phase approach and associated policies, where an initial upload plan is generated with prior knowledge of upload opportunities and data needs, and a subsequent runtime adaptation phase alters the plan based on dynamic network and data conditions. To validate our approach, we designed and built SCALECycle, a prototype mobile data collection platform and deployed it in real world community settings; measurements from testbeds in Rockville, MD and Irvine, CA are used to drive extensive simulations. Experimental results indicate that a judicious combination of policies in the two phases of upload planning (a balanced delay-opportunity-priority method with Lyapunov-inspired upload adaptation) can result in a 30-60% improvement in overall utility of collected data compared with opportunistic operation along with 30% reduction in collection delays /overheads.},

  pages={152-163},
  abstract={This paper considers the reliable delivery of sensor data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices to distributed cloud service instances in the face of localized failures for event detection, community infrastructure management, and emergency response. We develop and explore the notion of GEOgraphically Correlated Resilient Overlay Networks (GeoCRON) to capture the localized nature of community IoT deployments and their impact/vulnerability in the context of small failures and massive disruptions such as that caused by a large seismic event. As a focus use case, we study the viability and utility of GeoCRON in two different community sensor networks. The first, a large participatory sensing-style network of small inexpensive seismic sensors, reports ground motion in homes and businesses to a cloud service for detecting and characterizing earthquakes. The second, a smaller infrastructure-based network of wireless devices embedded in the water distribution network, reports water pressure changes at pipe junctions that may be indicative of leaks that require human intervention. Using realistic topologies derived from experiences with real world community scale deployments, we study the impact of geo-correlated failures on the combined network infrastructure and evaluate a range of GeoCRON heuristics to improve commnunications resilience in this context. We validate the promise of the proposed GeoCRON-based approach using extensive simulations and an initial prototype system implementation.},

  title={RichNote: Adaptive Selection and Delivery of Rich Media Notifications to Mobile Users}, 
  year={2016},
  volume={},

  pages={159-168},
  abstract={In recent years, notification services for social networks, mobile apps, messaging systems and other electronic services have become truly ubiquitous. When a new content becomes available, the service sends an instant notification to the user. When the content is produced in massive quantities, and it includes both large-size media and a lot of meta-information, it gives rise to a major challenge of selecting content to notify about and information to include in such notifications. We tackle three important challenges in realizing rich notification delivery: (1) content and presentation utility modeling, (2) notification selection and (3) scheduling of delivery. We consider a number of progressive presentation levels for the content. Since utility is subjective and hard to model, we rely on real data and user surveys. We model the content utility by learning from large-scale real world data collected from Spotify music streaming service. For the utility of the presentation levels we rely on user surveys. Blending these two techniques together, we derive utility of notifications with different presentation levels. We then model the selection and delivery of rich notifications as an optimization problem with a goal to maximize the utility of notifications under resource budget constraints. We validate our system with large-scale simulations driven by the real-world de-identified traces obtained from Spotify. With the help of several baseline approaches we show that our solution is adaptive and resource efficient.},
