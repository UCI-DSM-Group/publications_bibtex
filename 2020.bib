abstract = { This paper describes the collaborative effort between privacy and security researchers at nine different institutions along with researchers at the Naval Information Warfare Center to deploy, test, and demonstrate privacy-preserving technologies in creating sensor-based awareness using the Internet of Things (IoT) aboard naval vessels in the context of the US Navy’s Trident Warrior 2019 exercise. Funded by DARPA through the Brandeis program, the team built an integrated IoT data management middleware, entitled TIPPERS, that supports privacy by design and integrates a variety of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), including differential privacy, computation on encrypted data, and fine-grained policies. We describe the architecture of TIPPERS and its use in creating a smart ship that offers IoT-enabled services such as occupancy analysis, fall detection, detection of unauthorized access to spaces, and other situational awareness scenarios. We describe the privacy implications of creating IoT spaces that collect data that might include individuals’ data (e.g., location) and analyze the tradeoff between privacy and utility of the supported PETs in this context. }

  abstract  = "The growing deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) systems aims
               to ease the daily life of end-users by providing several
               value-added services. However, IoT systems may capture and store
               sensitive, personal data about individuals in the cloud, thereby
               jeopardizing user-privacy. Emerging legislation, such as
               California's CalOPPA and GDPR in Europe, support strong privacy
               laws to protect an individual's data in the cloud. One such law
               relates to strict enforcement of data retention policies. This
               paper proposes a framework, entitled IoT Expunge that allows
               sensor data providers to store the data in cloud platforms that
               will ensure enforcement of retention policies. Additionally, the
               cloud provider produces verifiable proofs of its adherence to
               the retention policies. Experimental results on a real-world
               smart building testbed show that IoT Expunge imposes minimal
               overheads to the user to verify the data against data retention
               policies.",

abstract = {Advances in sensing, networking, and actuation technologies have resulted in the IoT wave that is expected to revolutionize all aspects of modern society. This paper focuses on the new challenges of privacy that arise in IoT in the context of smart homes. Specifically, the paper focuses on preventing the user's privacy via inferences through channel and in-home device activities. We propose a method for securely scheduling the devices while decoupling the device and channels activities. The proposed solution avoids any attacks that may reveal the coordinated schedule of the devices, and hence, also, assures that inferences that may compromise individual's privacy are not leaked due to device and channel level activities. Our experiments also validate the proposed approach, and consequently, an adversary cannot infer device and channel activities by just observing the network traffic.},
