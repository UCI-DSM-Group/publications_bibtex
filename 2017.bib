abstract = {In this paper, we design and implement an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based platform for developing cities using environmental sensing as driving application with a set of air quality sensors that periodically upload sensor data to the cloud. Ubiquitous and free WiFi access is unavailable in most developing cities; IoT deployments must leverage 3G cellular connections that are expensive and metered. In order to best utilize the limited 3G data plan, we envision two adaptation strategies to drive sensing and sensemaking. The first technique is an infrastructure-level adaptation approach where we adjust sensing intervals of periodic sensors so that the data volume remains bounded within the plan. The second approach is at the information-level where application-specific analytics are deployed on board devices (or the edge) through container technologies (Docker and Kubernetes); the use case focuses on multimedia sensors that process captured raw information to lower volume semantic data that is communicated. This approach is implemented through the EnviroSCALE (Environmental Sensing and Community Alert Network) platform, an inexpensive Raspberry Pi based environmental sensing system that periodically publishes sensor data over a 3G connection with a limited data plan. We outline our deployment experience of EnviroSCALE in Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh. For information-level adaptation, we enhanced EnviroSCALE with Docker containers with rich media analytics, along Kubernetes for provisioning IoT devices and deploying the Docker images. To limit data communication overhead, the Docker images are preloaded in the board but a small footprint of analytic code is transferred whenever required. Our experiment results demonstrate the practicality of adaptive sensing and triggering rich sensing analytics via user-specified criteria, even over constrained data connections.},

  abstract={Modern IoT analytics are computational and data intensive. Existing analytics are mostly hosted in cloud data centers, and may suffer from high latency, network congestion, and privacy issues. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a fog computing platform that runs analytics in a distributed way on multiple devices, including IoT devices, edge servers, and data-center servers. We focus on the core optimization problem: making deployment decisions to maximize the number of satisfied IoT analytics. We carefully formulate the deployment problem and design an efficient algorithm, named SSE, to solve it. Moreover, we conduct a detailed measurement study to derive system models of the IoT analytics based on diverse QoS levels and heterogeneous devices to facilitate the optimal deployment decisions. We implement a testbed to conduct experiments, which show that the system models achieve reasonably good accuracy. More importantly, 100% of the deployed IoT analytics satisfy the QoS targets. We also conduct extensive simulations for larger-scale scenarios. The simulation results reveal that our SSE algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm by up to 89.4% and 168.3% in terms of the number of satisfied IoT analytics and active devices. In addition, our SSE algorithm reduces CPU, RAM, and network resource consumptions by 18.4%, 12.7%, and 898.3%, respectively, and terminates in polynomial time.},

abstract = "The Internet of Things has enabled new services to communities in many domains, e.g. smart healthcare, environmental awareness, and public safety. These services require timely and accurate event delivery, but such in-situ deployments are often limited by the coverage of sensing/communication infrastructures. In this paper we develop effective, scalable, and realistic data collection and upload solutions using mobile data collectors in community IoT systems. Specifically, we address the optimized upload planning problem, i.e. determine the optimal schedule for communication to enable timely data delivery under dynamicity in network connectivity, data characteristics/heterogeneity, and mobility. We develop a two-phase approach and associated policies, where an initial upload plan is generated offline with prior knowledge of networks and data, and a subsequent runtime adaptation alters the plan under multiple dynamics. To validate our approach, we designed and built SCALECycle, our mobile data collection platform, and deployed it in real communities in Rockville, MD and Irvine, CA. Measurements from these testbeds are used to drive extensive simulations. Experimental results indicate that compared with opportunistic operation, our two-phase approach using a judicious combination of policies can result in 30%â€“60% improvement in overall data utility, 30% reduction in collection delays, along with greater resilience to dynamicity and improved scalability."

abstract = {Current buildings rely on predefined rules to control the temperature in rooms disregarding their residents' thermal comfort. Multiple approaches have been presented in the literature to tackle this issue (e.g., by enabling occupants to express their feedback using their mobile devices). In general setting, to reach consensus among group members, we apply decision making methods (e.g., majority, mean, trimmed mean, and median) to aggregate the diverse expected comfort levels of the inhabitants. However, such methods might be unfair to some participants.In this paper, we present the first study of the issue of fairness in participatory thermal comfort control. Inspired by the traditional definitions in scheduling, we introduce a definition of fairness that is suitably adapted to the particularities of our scenario. We then present our design of an aggregation method that ensures fairness. Finally, we show how our algorithm behaves compared with traditional aggregation methods in diverse simulated scenarios.},

  abstract={Perpetual awareness systems are sensing systems characterized by continuous monitoring and ubiquitous sensing; they are essential to many safety and mission-critical applications, e.g. assisted living, healthcare and public safety. In this paper, we present SAFER, a perpetual heterogeneous IoT system; deployed in homes to detect critical events (injury, hazardous-environment) that must trigger immediate action and response. A key challenge here is the energy consumption associated with perpetual operations. We propose a novel energy-aware perpetual home IoT system where battery-operated and wall-powered IoT devices co-execute to ensure safety of occupants. We use a semantic approach that extracts activities-of-daily-living from device data to drive energy-optimized sensor activations. To validate our approach, we developed an elderly fall detection system using multi-personal and in-situ sensing devices. Using initial measurements to drive larger simulations, we show that our Cost-Function-Gradient algorithm can achieve greater than 4X reductions in energy dissipation without loss of sensing accuracy.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the way we interact with our environment in domains as diverse as health, transportation, office buildings and our homes. In smart building environments, information captured about the building and its inhabitants will aid in development of services that improve productivity, comfort, social interactions, safety, energy savings and more. However, by collecting and sharing information about building's inhabitants and their activities, these services also open the door to privacy risks. In this paper, we introduce a framework where IoT Assistants capture and manage the privacy preferences of their users and communicate them to privacy-aware smart buildings, which enforce them when collecting user data or sharing it with building services. We outline elements necessary to support such interactions and also discuss important privacy policy attributes that need to be captured. This includes looking at attributes necessary to describe - (1) the data collection and sharing practices associated with deployed sensors and services in smart buildings as well as (2) the privacy preferences to help users manage their privacy in such environments.},

AquaSCALE leverages dynamic data from multiple information sources including IoT (Internet of Things) sensing data, geophysical data, human input, and simulation/modeling engines to create a sensor-simulation-data integration platform that can accurately and quickly identify vul-nerable spots.

The profile then incorporates with external observations (NOAA weather reports and twitter feeds) to rapidly and reliably isolate broken water pipes. We evaluate the two-phase mechanism in canonical and real-world water networks under different failure scenarios.
